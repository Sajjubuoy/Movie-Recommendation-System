Movie Recommendation System
This is a simple content-based movie recommender system built using Python, NLP, and machine learning concepts. The system suggests similar movies based on your input using a technique called cosine similarity on text-based features.

 What the Project Does
 
# Takes a movie title as input.
# Analyzes its genre, cast, crew, keywords, and description.
# Recommends 5 similar movies.
#Also displays movie posters using The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

 Project Structure
This project has two main parts:

1. Backend (Data Processing & Recommendation Logic)
Step-by-Step Workflow:
Import Libraries
Use libraries like pandas, numpy, ast, scikit-learn, and pickle.

Load Data
Load two CSV files:

tmdb_5000_movies.csv

tmdb_5000_credits.csv

Merge Datasets
Combine both datasets on the movie title column.

Select Relevant Features
Use only the columns required for recommendation:
movie_id, title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, crew.

Clean and Parse Data

Convert stringified JSON columns into Python lists using ast.literal_eval.

Extract top 3 cast members.

Extract only the director from the crew.

Remove spaces from multi-word names (e.g., "Science Fiction" â†’ "ScienceFiction").

Create Tags
Combine overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew into one text column called tags.

Text Vectorization
Use CountVectorizer to convert tags into vectors (bag-of-words representation).

Similarity Calculation
Use cosine_similarity to compute similarity between movies based on tag vectors.

Recommend Function
Given a movie name, return the top 5 most similar movie titles.

Save Models
Use pickle to save:

movie_list.pkl (movie titles and metadata)

similarity.pkl (precomputed similarity matrix)

2. Frontend (Streamlit Web App)
Features:
Dropdown Menu
Lets users select or type a movie name.

Show Recommendation Button
Displays 5 similar movies when clicked.

Movie Posters
Uses TMDb API to fetch and display posters for each recommended movie.
